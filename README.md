# Freelance

I have been freelancing since January 2017 on https://www.freelancer.com. Here's [my account](https://www.freelancer.com/u/harupy#/) where you can see the projects I've completed and the reviews posted on me. I upload some of the projects I've completed in this repository.<br>
<br>

The service I provide includes (I mainly use Python) :
- web scraping (beautifulsoup)
- browser automation (selenium)
- data visualization (matplotlib)
- numerical calculation (numpy)
- image processing (opencv & pillow)

I also have [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJlw4oNDThhfdeiE57qLQuQ) where I upload videos about my Python programs.

# My Coding Experience

Proficient : Python, VBA, MATLAB <br>
Familiar with : Java, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

## Python
### Web Scraping
This is what I'm best at for Python. Web scraping is a technique to extract large amounts of data (text, image, video, etc.) automatically from the web. I've completed lots of web scraping projects on freelacer.com I mentioned above, so I have strong confidence in this technique. I learned web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and how to handle data in an effcient way while learning web scraping.

### Browser Automation
Python has a library which can control web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.). I use the library to automate the followiing.
- authentication process
- file upload and download
- google search
- web games
This is a sample program I posted on Youtube : <br>

### Automation for Lab Equipments
When I was a graduate student, I developed graphical user interfaces in Python which allows me to control lab equipments, such as laser, optical analyzer, and alignment stage from my laptop and automate experiments.

Other than the above, I have experience in :
- image processing
- numerical calculation
- data visualization
- database (MySQL)

## MATLAB
I used MATLAB for my research when I was a graduate student.

### Numerical Calculation
I wrote code to numerically solve a complex differential equation (called nonlinear Schoredinger equation) to simulate the performance of optical fibers I designed. I used MATLAB for a while, but I switched to Python later because it's much more flexible and easier to write code.

### Software Automation
I was using simulation softwares for optical fibers which can be controlled from MATLAB. I wrote code in MATLAB to automate simulations in the software and optimize the structure of optical fibers.

## VBA
### Automation for Excel, PowerPoint, and Word
I use VBA to automate the following.
- calculation
- data sorting and cleaning
- editing the format of shapes and charts
- alignment of shapes and charts
