# Freelancer

I have been freelancing since January 2017 in https://www.freelancer.com.<br>
This is [my account](https://www.freelancer.com/u/harupy#/) where you can see the projects I've completed and the reivews posted on me.

The service I provide includes (I mainly use Python)
- Web scraping (beautifulsoup)
- Browser automation (selenium)
- Data processing (pandas)
- Data visualization (matplotlib)
- Numerical calculation (numpy)
- Image processing (opencv & pillow)

Other than Python, I have experience in C++, Java, VBA, and JavaScript.

I started freelancing because I wanted to improve my coding skills and earn some money. Working as a freelancer gave me a chance to grow as a programmer.
